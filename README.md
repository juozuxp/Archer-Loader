# Archer-Loader
This was a loader for a project I've been developing and supporting for a few months, it's by no means perfect and that did result in it having multiple hickups uppon other issues. All in all it was a fun project to maintai while the hosted project lasted, since the host project has reached the end of it's life, I'm posting the sub project related to it. The code attached can be used for learning purposes, or refactored with new code to work once more. I will not be providing the copyrighted material initially related to said loader, I've tried my best to remove as much of it as possible, though if some is still left, I'll be sure to remove if I find it or am requested to do so.
